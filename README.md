## Software Security

Brief summarize of the client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements.

### Who was the client?
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. They want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security.

### What issue did they want you to address?
The issue they want Global Rain to solve is to help secure their client data and financial information by adding a file verification step to their web application to ensure secure communications. As part of the Global Rain team, I needed to help complete a data verification step in the form of a checksum. We added secure communication mechanisms to their current software application. The Global Rain team delivered a production-quality integrated application that met their software security requirements with secure coding protocols for Artemis Financial's system.

### What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities?
I believe I did well in conducting a manual review of the Artemis Financial code when searching for security vulnerabilities.

### Why is it important to code securely?
It is important to detect security vulnerabilities to protect the software from attacks on the data.

### What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
The value of software security is in protecting user data and lowering security risks.

### What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The most challenging part of working through the vulnerability assessment diagram was learning how to suppress false positives.

### How did you approach the need to increase layers of security?
I used various approaches to increase layers of security, including refactoring the code to incorporate HTTPS, which is more secure than HTTP.

### What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
To ensure software security, I would keep the application productive by calculating vulnerabilities and determining mitigation techniques.

### How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure?
I ensured the application was functional and secure by testing its functionality, running a new dependency check, and performing a static test. Regularly checking for available updates to dependencies was also part of the process.

### After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I checked for vulnerabilities by running the application before and after making changes, and performed a static test to see if any new vulnerabilities were created during the code refactoring.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used the Maven dependency checker tool to detect vulnerabilities, which was very helpful and will continue to be a useful resource for referring to dependencies in the future.

### What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
When displaying this assignment to an employer, I would want to showcase my experience with suppressing false positives, identifying vulnerabilities, and creating a secure HTTPS application. Showcasing my experience and skills from this project will help demonstrate to future employers that I’m proficient and reliable.
